# Public speaking

Short and sweet:

* Maximize use of images 
* Minimize use of text
* Max seven words per line
* Max three lines per slide \(excluding title\)
* Text as large as possible

[Best Practices from TED:](https://mobile.twitter.com/Martin_Jordan/status/922114139648069633)

* Slides can be helpful but are not necessary. Your talk can be strong enough also without slides. 
* Keep the quantity of text on each slide to a minimum. 
* Avoid using bullet points. Consider putting different points on different slides. 
* If you use bullet points, preferably no more than 3 bullet points per slide. 
* Better still are single images, one at a time - compelling photos or meaningful graphs. 
* Use very large fonts \(we suggest 72-128 points, and seriously try hard to avoid less than 6Opt\). 
* Everyone, including the back row, must be able to read every word. 
* Avoid using 'transitions' - they are often tiresome and they tend to be represented poorly in video. 
* If you use "builds," where parts of a slide are revealed gradually, best to make a separate slide for each stage of the build \(rather than counting on the presentation software to "behave" properly.\) 
* We strongly recommend that you only display text slides after speaking their contents. If you show text and then read it, the audience has gotten through it faster than you, and you'll start boring them. 
* The best use of slides will REMIND the audience of the point you just made, or to ILLUSTRATE an idea in a way that can't be spoken. \(A portrait might show the intensity of an emotional drama, or a graph could convey the significance of numerical data\). 
* Slides can also be used as PLACEHOLDERS describing the arc of your presentation's content. \(For instance, the first slide might say: "A journey of three cities", then the second could be "1. London", followed by "2. Paris" and "3. Rome", over the course of your talk. In this way, the text helps to frame your subject matter and to focus any wandering minds.\) 
* All images must be either your own, or Creative Commons with Non-Commercial Derivative Attribution rights, or else licensed and credited to the source. 

### Any questions?

Many talks end with the speaker asking the audience for questions. I do not like this practice and I spoke about it with my colleagues. Below are my insights based on those talks.

There are multiple reasons to not offer questions. First, you are giving someone else control of how your talk with end and how you will be remembered. If you care about what impression you leave behind then that's easier to do if you end the talk on your terms. Second, while they say there's no such thing as a bad question there is such a thing as a question that you don't want to make 20, 50, or 100+ people listen to. Many questions at conferences are something along the lines of: "Have you thought of ABC?", "I did XYZ and it worked for me, why didn't you do that?". Or even worse they're not even questions at all, but a listener looking to s tart a discussion. None of these are bad per se in a one on one conversation. But they are bad when you force the entire audience to listen to this interaction.

So I hope I've convinced you that questions are not a great way to end a talk. What can you do instead? Well you can offer the audience to come to you after the talk for a chat and discuss their views afterwards.

Finally, of course for some talks questions are very welcome, such as lectures/trainings/tutorials. I still don't like to end those talks with "any questions?". Instead I end them with "what are your questions?".
